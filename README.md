# Squirrel GObject

This project provides gobject introspectable bindings for the squirrel language. 

Squirrel language is written in C++ with a C API that is not introspectable. This project provides a thin, introspectable wrapper around Squirrels C API.

TLDR; this lets you run Squirrel scripts in Vala, RUST, Javascript, Python etc etc and even Lua.
